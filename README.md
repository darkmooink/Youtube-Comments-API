### Challenges
1. Defining the scope of the project
2. Integrating with the YouTube Data API

### Achievements
+ [x] Successfully pulled Youtube comments associated to given valid video id
+ [x] Successfully analysed and categorised each comment pulled
+ [x] Successfully provided a full coverage testing for the application apis
+ [x] Successfully managed our project using Trello

### Future Development
+ [ ] Provide an interesting frontend for the application

  - This installs all the packages required for the project as defined in the `package.json` file.
5. Configure Environment Variables
  - Create three `.env` files based on the `.env.template`:
  
    1. **Development Environment**:

      - Copy `.env.template` to `.env.development`.
      - Configure with values for the development environment.

    2. **Test Environment**:

      - Copy `.env.template` to `.env.test`.
      - Set variables for the testing environment.

    3. **Live Environment**:

      - Copy `.env.template` to `.env.live`.
      - Fill in variables for the live environment.

**Please Note:** These files are crucial for configuring the project in different environments.

#### Getting Started

-   Run `npm start` to run in a development enviroment
-   Run `npm test` to run the unit tests
-   Run `npm run test-w` to run the unit tests in jest watch mode
-   Run `npm run live` to run the live enviroment.
-   View the landing page here: http://localhost:3000/youtubecomments/api/v1/ to 
-   Use POSTMAN / browser to view categorisation of comments -
